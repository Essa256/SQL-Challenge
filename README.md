## SQL Challenge - Pewlett Hackard Employee Database

This repository contains a project focused on the Pewlett Hackard company's SQL Challenge. It involves working with a dataset from the 1980s and 1990s, encompassing data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis tasks using SQL.

### Background

As a data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, your main objective is to conduct a research project on employees who worked at the company during the 1980s and 1990s. The project encompasses:

- **Data Modeling**: Designing an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) or table schemas for the database.
- **Data Engineering**: Creating the database tables by defining data types, keys, and relationships. Importing data from CSV files into these tables.
- **Data Analysis**: Addressing specific questions about the employee data through SQL queries.

### Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **ERD**: Contains the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) or table schemas (`schema.png`) for the database.

- **SQL**: Holds the SQL script (`pewlett_hackard.sql`) used to create the database schema and conduct data analysis.

- **Data**: Contains CSV files with the employee data used in the project.

- **README.md**: Provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and details about the SQL queries used for data analysis.

### Data Analysis

The `pewlett_hackard.sql` script contains SQL queries addressing various data analysis tasks such as:

- Displaying employee details like employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
- Identifying employees hired in 1986.
- Listing department managers along with department information.
- Associating each employee with their respective department.
- Searching for specific employees by name and department.
- Analyzing the frequency of employee last names.

These queries provide valuable insights into the Pewlett Hackard Employee Database.
